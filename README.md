# Cars_API

 Over the years, what an “API” is has often described any sort of generic connectivity interface to an application. More recently, however, the modern API has taken on some characteristics that make them extraordinarily valuable and useful:

  Modern APIs adhere to standards (typically HTTP and REST), that are developer-friendly, easily accessible and understood broadly

  They are treated more like products than code. They are designed for consumption for specific audiences (e.g., mobile developers), they are documented, and they are versioned in a way that users can have certain expectations of its maintenance and lifecycle.

  My current goal is to create a API Project to show my love of Automobiles.
